---

## üëã Intro

An **event‚Äëdriven, microservice e‚Äëcommerce demo** built with **Spring Boot 3 + Kafka + PostgreSQL**.

> The **main goal**  of the application is to enable users to **SELECT ‚Üí RESERVE ‚Üí PAY** for desired items.

This project is intended as **a code showroom** to demonstrate core coding and architecture skills;\
_**it is not a production-ready system**_.

## üß© Architecture

### High‚Äëlevel overview

---

The Shop Platform is built as an **event-driven microservices** ecosystem. All inter-service communication happens asynchronously over **Apache Kafka** topics; services react to domain events rather than blocking synchronous calls. Users interact via a **WebSocket-powered gateway**, which translates UI commands into Kafka commands and fans out state updates to the browser **in real time**.


> _**Note:**_ For clarity, the Kafka event bus is not shown; **all arrows represent _asynchronous event messages_ on Kafka topics**.

> This sequence diagram shows how our event-driven checkout saga plays out from end to end. When the user clicks **MAKE ORDER** in the UI, the gateway publishes a `CreateOrder` event, which the Order Service immediately persists, then fires off a `ReserveStock` command to the Stock Service. If inventory is available, Stock sends back a reservation confirmation, the Order Service marks the order **RESERVED**, computes a payment deadline, and asks the Payment Service to build a Stripe checkout link. This link sends back to the Order service. By clicking PAY button in the UI the user is then redirected to Stripe‚Äôs hosted checkout - to complete the payment. Once Stripe calls our webhook with `checkout.session.completed`, the Payment Service emits `PaymentSuccessful`, the Order Service transitions to **PAID**, and the gateway pushes the final `OrderPaid` event to the browser.

> If stock isn‚Äôt available, the Stock Service immediately raises an `OutOfStock` event and we cancel the order. Likewise, if the user never pays before the **TTL (Time To Live)** expires, a background scheduler in the Order Service automatically cancels the reservation and publishes a `StockRelease` event to restore inventory. By orchestrating everything through Kafka topics and idempotent consumers, we achieve loose coupling, clear separation of concerns, and eventual consistency across microservices.

## üöß Next Steps & Known Gaps

While this demo covers the core **SELECT ‚Üí RESERVE ‚Üí PAY** flow, here are a few things to sort out before calling this production-ready:

- **Authentication & Authorization**  
  No user login, session management or role-based access control. All actions are anonymous.

- **API Documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)**  
  No Swagger UI.

- **Observability & Monitoring**  
  No metrics (Prometheus), tracing (OpenTelemetry/Brave), or centralized logging (Grafana) is configured.

- **Resilience Patterns**  
  No any circuit breakers, retry/backoff logic, or dead-letter queues - so if a downstream service hiccups, the flow can just hang or fail silently.

- **Saga Coordination & Idempotency**  
  Platform based on pure choreography, so there‚Äôs no central saga tracker or idempotency keys on our commands and webhooks.

- **Refunds & Partial Cancellations**  
  No flow for issuing refunds, handling disputes, or partially cancelling orders.

- **Secrets & Configuration Management**  
  Stripe API keys and service URLs are just sitting in `application.yml` or env vars in plain text - there‚Äôs no Vault or Kubernetes Secrets setup to keep them safe.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**  
  Haven‚Äôt set up any automated CI/CD, load/performance testing, or coverage reporting yet.

- **Clustered Deployment & High Availability**  
  Kafka and Postgres just running as a single-node trio in Docker Compose - no Kubernetes setup or HA configuration.

- **Schema Evolution & Registry**  
  Not using a schema registry for our Kafka messages, so keeping track of versions can get messy.

- **Documentation & Diagrams**  
  Only have those Mermaid snippets in the README - there‚Äôs no standalone architecture guide, separate sequence diagram docs, or any ADRs.

Addressing these gaps would take this demo from **"showroom"** to a more robust, production-ready platform.
